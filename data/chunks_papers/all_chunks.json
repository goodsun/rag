Neural network-based language models are known to form internal representations that hold structural relationships. Also, multimodal language models form internal representations shared by language and perceptual information. Artificial cognitive systems develop internal representations 1 1 1 In this paper, “internal representations” simply refer to neural activation patterns in natural and artificial neural networks. Note that the usage of the term “internal representations” does not imply that the authors hold computationalism as in classical symbolic AI  (Newell, 1980 ) . through a dual process: bottom-up integration of sensory-motor information and top-down incorporation of linguistic knowledge, resulting in multimodal internal representations. Language, by imposing structure on these representations, may significantly influence how sensory-motor information is organized internally. For humans, sharing language may lead to structurally similar qualia structures across individuals. Thus, language serves not just as a communication tool, but as an aligning force for subjective experiences. Harmonization of sensory-motor and linguistic information into internal representations fundamentally shapes our perception, interpretation, and interaction with the world, underscoring the profound influence of language on human cognition and conscious experience, while language itself emerges in human society on the basis of our physical and social interactions, i.e., language emergence.\n",

We acknowledge, however, that the precise mapping between representational structure and qualia structure is known to be complex and likely indirect. 2 2 2 \\added Indeed, the actual relationship between the structure of internal representations and qualia structure is highly complex, rather than a simple one-to-one mapping assumed here as a working hypothesis. Evidence from various domains, including recovery processes in neurorehabilitation (Stefaniak and Fink, 2011 ) , phenomena like anosognosia for visual deficits (Michel et al., 2024 ) , and studies on the neural correlates of perception (Pollen, 1999 ) , suggests that significant changes in neural states or representations do not always entail straightforward changes in subjective experience. Such complexities may potentially be understood through concepts like neural plasticity and degeneracy (i.e., the ability of structurally different neural systems to yield the same output or function) (Tononi and Edelman, 1998 ; Price and Friston, 2002 ) . A detailed analysis of this intricate neural-phenomenal mapping problem is beyond the scope of the present paper, which focuses specifically on the interplay between emergent language and qualia structure.",

This definition carries no commitment to claims about qualia being intrinsically private or ineffable. Because our goal is to analyse how such experiential qualities are organized rather than to address the metaphysical “hard problem,” we retain the concise term qualia instead of longer equivalents such as quality of experience. We refer to the relational pattern formed by these experiential qualities as a qualia structure. This notion corresponds to what others call a quality‑space structure, but we adopt “structure” because it is both briefer and, mathematically, more general, allowing for richer relational descriptions beyond simple metric spaces ( Kleiner ( 2024 ) ; see also Lee and Fink ( 2023 ) ). While the present paper does not attempt to resolve the hard problem, we assume—following Kawakita et al. ( 2025 ) —that certain phenomenal properties can be empirically investigated by focusing on the relationships among qualia.",

( 2013b ) ). \\added There is a substantial body of psycholinguistic research investigating the influence of language on perception. For example,  Winawer et al. ( 2007 ) demonstrated that Russian speakers, who lexically distinguish between light blue and dark blue, were faster at performing perceptual discrimination tasks involving these two shades than English speakers, whose language does not make this lexical distinction. Furthermore,   (Thierry et al., 2009 ) employed event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine the temporal dynamics of such language-related perceptual differences following stimulus presentation. Their findings revealed that these effects emerged as early as 100 ms post-stimulus, a time window associated with activity in the primary and secondary visual cortices. These results suggest that early stages of color perception can be modulated by one’s native language. Furthermore, recent studies have argued that since closely related non-human primates do not exhibit human-like color categories, the emergence of consensus-based color categories in humans likely depends on language (e.g.,   Garside et al. ( 2025 ) ). \\added These findings suggest that language play a significant role in shaping human perceptual categorization. Furthermore, distributional semantics argues that a word’s meaning can be determined by analyzing its statistical distribution and co-occurrence patterns with other words in large text corpora. Large language models (LLMs) exploit the nature of distributional semantics. \\deleted However, to what extent the structure of language affects qualia structure in human consciousness is still a mystery.\n",

Empirical studies have approached this issue with two main questions in mind: how speakers of different languages perceive the world (e.g.,  Berlin and Kay ( 1969 ) ) and how children’s perception of the world changes as they acquire their native languages (e.g.,  Roberson et al. ( 2004 ) ). Research to date has revealed two key findings: 1) biologically based perceptual experience forms the foundation for language acquisition, and 2) individual languages exert a powerful influence on the perceptual experiences of speakers. A well-known traditional example of the first is the study in the domain of color. Linguistic and anthropological studies have reported that many languages share a part of color lexicon, suggesting the existence of a universal perceptual basis in human beings ( Berlin and Kay ( 1969 ); Regier et al. ( 2005 ) ). Moreover, developmental studies have demonstrated that even pre-linguistic infants perceive such colors categorically ( Yang et al. ( 2016 ) ). \\added Moriguchi et al. ( 2025 ) examined how children and adults in Japan and China judge the relationships among multiple colors using a similarity judgment task. Remarkably, the results revealed no substantial differences in the structure of color similarity across cultures or age groups. These findings, we believe, further suggest the existence of universal aspects of color categorization. The second point has sparked more intense debate. While many earlier studies reported that the influence of language on perception is limited to experimental tasks where language can be implicitly engaged (e.g., Winawer et al. ( 2007 ); Roberson et al. ( 2000 ); Davidoff et al. ( 1999 ); Gilbert et al. ( 2006 ) ), more recent studies increasingly show that language effects manifest even in purely non-linguistic contexts (e.g., Thierry et al. ( 2009 ) ). \\added Thus, the current focus of psychological research is not whether language affects perception (i.e., the issue originally asked in the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis), but rather in what task contexts and to what extent language influences perception (Imai et al., 2016 ) . However, current evidence, \\deleted considering \\added considered across all cognitive and perceptual domains, has not reached convergence. It is possible that the degrees of these influences are highly dependent on various factors that are currently unknown.",

As a result, the language w 𝑤 w italic_w becomes a representation of the agents’ internal representations { z k } k subscript superscript 𝑧 𝑘 𝑘 \\{z^{k}\\}_{k} { italic_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT in terms of representation learning. This means language encodes the structure of internal representations in a collective manner. \\added One influential framework for understanding the structure of such internal representations and concepts, particularly their grounding in perception and relation to language, is Gärdenfors’ theory of Conceptual Spaces (Gärdenfors, 2000 ) . Also, the internal representation system z k superscript 𝑧 𝑘 z^{k} italic_z start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT of the k 𝑘 k italic_k -th agent reflects the structure of sensory-motor information of the k 𝑘 k italic_k -th agent’s \\deleted world, or its Umwelt \\added perceptual world.\n",

The classification of qualia in Table 1 can be compared to that of signs in semiotics. According to Peirce, signs can be classified into qualisigns, sinsigns, and legisigns, corresponding to firstness, secondness, and thirdness, which is a general trichotomy in Peirce’s philosophy, respectively. Qualisigns refer to a quality as a base-potentiality of being perceived as something. In this context, the base level corresponds to the qualisign. Sinsigns emerge each time a perceiver interacts with the qualities, corresponding to perceived colors or shapes in the intermediate level. Finally, legisigns are linguistic meanings or concepts that arise in relation to colors, shapes, and conventions. For example, if the perceiver who perceives colors or shapes finally regards the object as a cup, the concept of cup is a legisign. There is a hierarchical relationship in which legisigns are based on sinsigns which are, in turn, based on qualisigns.",

( 2023 ) for a review), partly due to the recent rapid development of deep learning. In addition to the developments in machine learning, construction and public-sharing of large datasets about human behaviors make human-machine comparisons feasible and meaningful. In particular, the creative use of online cloud sourcing has generated massive behavioral datasets of unprecedented size. For example, Hebart et al. created similarity judgment datasets on 1,854 natural objects by collecting about 6,000,000 similarity judgment responses (Hebart et al., 2020 ) , and Roads and Love created similarity judgment datasets on 50,000 images from the ILSVRC validation dataset by collecting about 400,000 similarity judgment responses (Roads and Love, 2020 ) . As another example, Kawakita et al. created similarity judgment datasets of 93 colors from color-neurotypical and atypical participants, a total of about 700 participants (Kawakita et al., 2025 , 2023 ) . Such massive datasets, in which qualia structures can be estimated, should be readily used to investigate the mutual influence between language and internal representations discussed in this article.",

RSA compares representational structures, such as representational similarity matrices for the same stimulus set, obtained as behavioral data, neural measurements, or model outputs. Then, the representational similarity matrices are compared based on, for example, a correlation coefficient. A high correlation indicates the similarity of the two representational structures. Typically, this type of comparison assumes predefined correspondences, such as a given item in one domain is correspondingly represented as the same item in the other domain. Such comparisons are called “supervised comparison” or “supervised alignment”. Supervised comparison (or alignment) gives us a rough idea of the similarity between representational structures.",

Unsupervised alignment does not assume correspondences between the representations of the stimuli beforehand, but rather finds optimal correspondences during the optimization processes of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance 5 5 5 \\added The Gromov-Wasserstein distance is a metric used in optimal transport theory to compare the structure of two metric measure spaces without relying on any prior point-to-point correspondence, making it suitable for unsupervised comparison of relational structures (see e.g., Mémoli, 2011 ) . . This allows us to test the validity of the very assumption that, for example, the internal representations of the set of same stimuli should correspond to those inferred from behavioral responses. For example, Kawakita et al. explored the possibility that the experience of colors might be relationally different between different individuals (Kawakita et al., 2025 ) . In assessing the similarity between the structures of human qualia and the internal representations of models, we encourage the use of unsupervised alignment to assess a stronger level of structural similarity or a finer level of structural difference beyond a simple correlation coefficient (Kawakita et al., 2023 ; Sasaki et al., 2023 ; Takahashi et al., 2024 ) .",

Using the aforementioned large dataset of 93 color similarity judgments, Kawakita et al. showed that a state-of-the-art multimodal language model (GPT4) has strikingly similar representations of 93 colors to those of color-neurotypical humans, to the point where the two representations are almost perfectly aligned in an unsupervised manner (Kawakita et al., 2023 ) . On the other hand, GPT3.5, which is an earlier version and an unimodal language model without vision, did not have similar representations unlike GPT4. Yet, GPT3.5 still has better alignment performance compared to popular simple color models such as RGB and CIELAB. At this point, it is unclear which factors of GPT4 make such remarkably good alignment with humans. In the context of the topic in this paper, it is intriguing to investigate whether such internal representations can be obtained through visual learning alone (i.e., \\deleted upward causation \\added upward organization), or they require a combination of language and vision learning (i.e., bidirectional \\deleted causation \\added influence).",

If multiple individuals within a community are similarly influenced by the downward constraints imposed by a shared, emergent linguistic system (like the signs developed in the naming game), it follows that their internal representational structures would tend towards greater coordination or similarity with each other. Indeed, computational studies in emergent communication provide supporting evidence for this possibility; for example, visually-grounded referential games have shown that language emergence can lead to aligned internal representations among agents (though challenges remain in capturing deeper conceptual properties)  (Bouchacourt and Baroni, 2018 ) , and explicitly encouraging alignment during the learning process can improve performance on tasks requiring compositionality  (Kouwenhoven et al., 2024 ) . While these studies demonstrate this potential, the emergence of more complex compositional or syntactic language and its potential to align the deeper relational structure of internal representations across individuals remains a significant challenge and direction for future constructive research. Nonetheless, this perspective highlights the potential pathway from individual experience, through emergent communication, to inter-personally coordinated representational structures, outlining a key aspect of the bidirectional influence this paper explores.",

One significant challenge concerns the interpretation of findings from computational models—particularly the difficulty in distinguishing qualia structures from purely linguistic structures when comparing models to human data or other AI systems. While our framework explicitly aims to model the interaction between linguistic structure and the structure of perceptual experience (cf. qualia structure), we do not insist that computational models possess genuine qualia. The scientific value lies in using these models to investigate the emergence, interaction, and potential coordination of structural patterns that are hypothesized to correlate with subjective experience in humans. This allows analysis that goes beyond linguistic structure alone, focusing on the dynamics of potentially qualia-relevant representational geometries. Further limitations include the inherent difficulty in precisely characterizing the mapping between internal representational structures and qualia structures, given the complexities of neural coding, plasticity, and degeneracy (as noted in Footnote 2).",

      "abstract": "This perspective paper explores the bidirectional influence between language emergence and the relational structure of subjective experiences, termed qualia structure, and lays out a constructive approach to the intricate dependency between the two. We hypothesize that the emergence of languages with distributional semantics (e.g., syntactic-semantic structures) is linked to the coordination of internal representations shaped by experience, potentially facilitating more structured language through reciprocal influence. This hypothesized mutual dependency connects to recent advancements in AI and symbol emergence robotics, and is explored within this paper through theoretical frameworks such as the collective predictive coding. Computational studies show that neural network-based language models form systematically structured internal representations, and multimodal language models can share representations between language and perceptual information. This perspective suggests that language emergence serves not only as a mechanism creating a communication tool but also as a mechanism for allowing people to realize shared understanding of qualitative experiences. The paper discusses the implications of this bidirectional influence in the context of consciousness studies, linguistics, and cognitive science, and outlines future constructive research directions to further explore this dynamic relationship between language emergence and qualia structure.",

A central puzzle, however, lies in their apparent grasp of the structure of the physical world. LLMs, trained on vast corpora of text, are not designed to interact with an environment and lack any direct sensorimotor experience  [ 4 , 10 ] . Yet, they seem to possess what could be described as a “world model.” How can an LLM acquire such a rich model of the world without ever having perceived or acted within it? This paper proposes a theoretical solution to this fundamental question.",

A growing body of evidence suggests that LLMs acquire surprisingly rich representations of the real world. For instance, some studies show that LLMs implicitly learn representations corresponding to vision and hearing just by reading text [ 133 ] , and that specific spatiotemporal representations emerge within their activations [ 36 ] . Furthermore, this internal knowledge proves functionally potent; LLMs can be used as world models for complex planning tasks [ 46 ] , and their distributional semantics can be grounded in the physical world to guide robotic perception and action [ 93 , 142 ] . Conversely, other work has revealed that LLMs are not reliable world simulators, suggesting their internal models are brittle or fundamentally different from those of embodied agents [ 136 ] .

A central theme in this research, particularly in studies employing language games and powered by deep neural networks  [ 31 , 84 , 55 ] , is the extent to which the resulting protocols, or emergent languages (EmLangs), resemble human language. For instance, questions have been raised about whether EmLangs exhibit compositionality  [ 65 , 14 ] , follow well-known statistical properties of natural languages  [ 15 , 105 , 131 , 129 ] , or can be shaped by cognitive constraints  [ 104 , 57 ] .",

This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.",

This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction.

The “World Models” approach by Ha and Schmidhuber, for instance, demonstrated that an agent could learn a compressed latent dynamics model from pixel inputs and use it to train a controller entirely within its own “dream”  [ 38 , 37 ] . This line of research was significantly advanced by the Dreamer series of models, which successfully applied latent dynamics models to challenging continuous control tasks and even discrete Atari benchmarks and Minecraft  [ 40 , 39 , 41 , 42 ] . While many of these models rely on reconstructing observations, alternative approaches have also been explored. For example, some models focus on learning latent dynamics through contrastive learning without reconstruction  [ 67 , 89 , 90 ] , or by incorporating specific physical priors into the latent space, such as in NewtonianVAE  [ 54 , 91 ] . Furthermore, to handle information from multiple viewpoints, which is crucial in multi-agent settings, approaches like Multi-View Dreaming have been proposed to construct a world model from multi-view images using contrastive learning  [ 63 ] .",

This non-generative, self-supervised method aims to capture the underlying dependencies of the data, encouraging the model to learn semantic and predictive features rather than superficial details. The JEPA framework has proven effective for learning world models from various modalities, including images (I-JEPA)  [ 7 ] and videos (V-JEPA)  [ 9 ] .

Without a clear answer, our understanding of large-scale phenomena, such as the emergence of world knowledge in LLMs, remains incomplete. The need for a theoretical framework that can explain the dynamic and semantic aspects of language emergence in embodied cognitive developmental systems still remains  [ 79 , 123 , 13 , 117 ] , and this paper aims to provide such a framework.",

This approach provides a unified framework for understanding symbol emergence, language evolution, and the nature of linguistic knowledge from the perspective of environmental adaptation and brain science.",

It demonstrates that minimizing a single, unified objective function, the CFE, naturally gives rise to two distinct processes. The second term corresponds to each agent minimizing its own individual free energy, which involves learning to accurately reconstruct its observations (the prediction error term) while keeping its internal representations regularized (the individual regularization term).

While both are founded on the ELBO principle, they differ significantly in scope and structure. The signaling game ELBO typically models a two-agent, one-shot, and often asymmetric (sender/receiver) interaction. In contrast, the CFE provides a formulation for a population of K 𝐾 K italic_K agents engaged in a continuous, decentralized process of collective sense-making. The CFE’s explicit decomposition into individual and collective terms provides a richer, more structured model of the interplay between individual learning and social language emergence, a distinction that conventional signaling game formulations do not typically make explicit.",

However, the broader CPC framework does not depend on this. On the contrary, when applied to general multi-agent cooperation, its core strength lies in integrating different, partially observable perspectives, as we will discuss in Section 4. . This assumption may seem strange from the game-theoretic approach to EmCom, but it is a deliberate choice made to depart from the feedback-dependent principle of success or failure that underpins many such models. Developmental studies suggest that such explicit feedback interactions are rarely observed in natural language acquisition and are an implausible metaphor for how infants learn  [ 126 ] . For human infants, joint attention is not a consequence of a communicative act, but rather a cognitive foundation that is in place before the vocabulary explosion occurs. Furthermore, children engaging in learning presuppose a pedagogical intention from adults  [ 23 ] , rather than simply testing a communication channel. Therefore, by assuming cooperative behavior grounded in joint attention, MHNG, as an example of generative EmCom, better aligns with empirical findings in human communication behavior than conventional discriminative models.",

[ 49 ] ).\n4 Emergence of a Collective World Model through Multi-Agent Interaction and Cooperation\nThe previous section used the MHNG to illustrate decentralized inference under the simplified assumption of joint attention. This section expands upon that principle, turning to more general multi-agent systems where joint attention is not required. Here, the essence of the CPC framework becomes clear: to integrate the diverse, partially observable perspectives of multiple agents through communication. We will explore how an emergent language allows agents to resolve their individual uncertainties and coordinate their actions by inferring a shared understanding of the world. This exploration begins with the application of Generative EmCom to MARL, considering that Type 1 world models are theoretically rooted in reinforcement learning studies.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.",

This hierarchy progresses through three levels of increasing complexity. Level A represents the bidirectional relationship between a static observation, such as an image x k subscript 𝑥 𝑘 x_{k} italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , and a linguistic description m 𝑚 m italic_m . This includes both image captioning (inferring m 𝑚 m italic_m from x k subscript 𝑥 𝑘 x_{k} italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and image generation (generating x k subscript 𝑥 𝑘 x_{k} italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from m 𝑚 m italic_m )  [ 134 , 139 , 102 ] . Level B extends this to dynamic sequences, where the language m 𝑚 m italic_m corresponds to a stream of observations over time, { x t k } t = 1 : T subscript subscript superscript 𝑥 𝑘 𝑡 : 𝑡 1 𝑇 \\{x^{k}_{t}\\}_{t=1:T} { italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t = 1 : italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , as seen in video captioning and generation tasks  [ 132 , 140 ] . The hierarchy culminates in Level C, which models the full sensorimotor loop of an embodied agent. Here, language m 𝑚 m italic_m is grounded in both dynamic perception { x t k } t = 1 : T subscript subscript superscript 𝑥 𝑘 𝑡 : 𝑡 1 𝑇 \\{x^{k}_{t}\\}_{t=1:T} { italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t = 1 : italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and a sequence of actions { a t k } t = 1 : T subscript subscript superscript 𝑎 𝑘 𝑡 : 𝑡 1 𝑇 \\{a^{k}_{t}\\}_{t=1:T} { italic_a start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t = 1 : italic_T end_POSTSUBSCRIPT .

Therefore, we argue that embodied symbol emergence , under the CPC framework, is collective world modeling.",

While these works establish that world-like representations can emerge, they primarily focus on how these representations can be leveraged. Our hypothesis, in contrast, provides a more fundamental explanation for why such rich, world-congruent knowledge is present in the first place. Similarly, Andreas argues that LLMs model the beliefs and intentions of agents within the linguistic space   [ 4 ] . Our framework complements and grounds this view by proposing that these linguistic agent models emerge precisely because the language itself is a reflection of a collective model formed by embodied agents interacting within a shared physical environment.",

Huh et al. introduced the platonic representation hypothesis, proposing that internal representations learned from language ( q L ⁢ ( z | m ) subscript 𝑞 𝐿 conditional 𝑧 𝑚 q_{L}(z|m) italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z | italic_m ) ) and vision ( q V ⁢ ( z | x ) subscript 𝑞 𝑉 conditional 𝑧 𝑥 q_{V}(z|x) italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z | italic_x ) ) converge toward a similar latent structure  [ 51 ] . Within the CPC framework, this alignment is not a surprising outcome that requires a pre-existing platonic ideal, but an expected one. Since human language ( m 𝑚 m italic_m ) emerges as a structured representation of collective observations of the world ( x = { x k } k 𝑥 subscript superscript 𝑥 𝑘 𝑘 x=\\{x^{k}\\}_{k} italic_x = { italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), it is natural that a model trained on language ( q L ⁢ ( z | m ) subscript 𝑞 𝐿 conditional 𝑧 𝑚 q_{L}(z|m) italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_L end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z | italic_m ) ) would learn a latent space whose structure mirrors that of a model trained on direct observation ( q V ⁢ ( z | x ) subscript 𝑞 𝑉 conditional 𝑧 𝑥 q_{V}(z|x) italic_q start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_V end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z | italic_x ) ).

We introduced the concept of generative EmCom as an alternative formulation of the conventional EmCom, which is based on a discriminative model-based language game such as referential games, and described their relationships. The concept, generative EmCom, is based on the CPC hypothesis, which demonstrates the modeling of language emergence as decentralized Bayesian inference of shared latent representations.

According to the proposed theoretical framework, a language formed by multiple agents with the same embodiment learning in the same environment should serve as an appropriate prior distribution for individual world models. In other words, EmLang should accelerate both world model learning and following environmental adaptation based on RL and other methods. Obtaining constructive evidence for this relationship is also crucial.",

We proposed the “Collective World Model” hypothesis, arguing that LLMs learn from a rich representational structure that is the product of a society-wide, interactive sense-making process. We provided a formal foundation for this claim with the framework of Generative EmCom, which models language emergence as a decentralized Bayesian inference process driven by the principles of CPC. This perspective unifies the cognitive processes of the individual with the collective evolution of language, offering a coherent explanation for the remarkable capabilities of modern AI and charting a path toward a deeper integration of communication, perception, and action in intelligent systems.",

One of the most straightforward approaches is to use deep learning to acquire representations from the external world and then process these representations using symbolic AI. For symbolic AI to effectively manipulate these representations, it is necessary to acquire independent representations of each factor, a concept known in deep learning as disentangled representations  ( bengio2013representation ) . Disentangled representations allow the system to clearly distinguish between different factors, making reasoning and manipulation more straightforward. For example, higgins2017beta demonstrated that disentangled representations in generative models, such as the β 𝛽 \\beta italic_β -VAE, enable a clear separation of independent factors of variation in data, thereby improving the ability to perform tasks such as causal reasoning and transfer learning. locatello2019challenging highlighted that although fully unsupervised disentanglement is challenging, leveraging some form of inductive bias or weak supervision can significantly improve the learning of disentangled representations.",

By combining introspective reasoning with external tool utilization, the model can actively think at each step while retrieving the necessary information, enabling it to solve more complex problems than would be possible with chain-of-thought alone. Toolformer is a model that, through self-supervised learning, acquires the ability to autonomously decide which external API tool to use and when to call upon it. This can be likened to how humans, when facing computations they cannot handle entirely in their head, may resort to writing on paper or consulting a dictionary. By allowing a pause in the continuous stream of text generation to explicitly call an API and wait for its results, the model incorporates a step-by-step, planful thinking process.",

For example, LangChain  ( langchain ) serves as a framework for integrating LLMs with external tools, incorporating prompt designs and tool interactions inspired by approaches like ReAct. Additionally, efforts such as Auto-GPT  ( autogpt2023 ) and BabyAGI  ( babyagi2023 ) have emerged to develop agents that engage in continuous reasoning and planning while interacting with external environments to achieve long-term goals. Unlike single-turn Q&amp;A models, these agents dynamically formulate plans, retrieve external resources as needed, and iteratively execute tasks to accomplish user-defined objectives. As a result, the \"System 2\"-like approach has become increasingly significant in the design and implementation of LLM agents.",

Language is believed to have co-evolved with the human brain  ( deacon1998symbolic ) , signifying a shift from individual to collective intelligence as the defining characteristic of our species. The idea of intelligence and life as collective phenomena has been a recurring topic of interest. The complexity and plasticity of language are fundamental to the formation of human societies and civilizations. Without these traits, the development of modern society and civilization would be difficult to imagine.

Recent studies, particularly from the Project Bergson in Japan (PBJ), have brought new insights into his work ( hirai2016 ; miyake_hirai_2018 ; tani2018 ; fujita2022 ; yoneda2022 ; hirai2022 ; hirai2023 ) . This new interdisciplinary approach is termed “Expanded Bergsonism” ( miquel2023 ) . According to hirai2022 , Bergson’s philosophy of time differs from traditional approaches by emphasizing multiple intrinsic timescales. This subsection outlines Bergson’s Multi-Timescale (MTS) interpretation in relation to System 0/1/2/3. The multi-timescale interpretation inspired by Bergson aligns naturally with contemporary cognitive architectures and robotics frameworks, particularly the hierarchical temporal dynamics observed in neuro-dynamical systems such as MTRNN and RNNPB, discussed in Section 2.1.2.",

The notion of multiple intrinsic timescales has largely been overlooked. In contrast, Bergson focused on the proper timescales inherent to each local interaction system. His renowned example of “sugar dissolving in water” illustrates that each event has its own duration, “which cannot be extended or shortened at will” ( bergson1907 , p. 10). Different solutes or solvents require different times.

Just as heat diffusion or chemical reactions require a specific durations, organisms also need specific intervals to perceive situations and perform actions. Thus, sensorymotor processes can be viewed as “relaxation times” required to re-stabilize the system. Bergson defined the “thickness” of the present as follows: the real present “necessarily occupies a duration” and is “in its essence, sensorimotor” ( bergson1896 , p. 153).

Furthermore, it offers potential for broader discussions concerning the philosophy of consciousness and more expansive conceptions of time. Extending dual-process theory and elucidating its connections to Bergson’s philosophy of time could prove crucial for advancing philosophical discourse in these areas.\n3 System 0/1/2/3: A Quad-Process Framework",

These processes leverage the intrinsic physical properties of the body to perform adaptive behaviors and computations, often more efficiently than neural control alone. By incorporating System 0, our framework acknowledges the critical role of embodiment in cognition, highlighting how the body’s structure and interaction with the environment contribute to intelligent behavior.

Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson&#39;s philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.",

At the same time, through inter-agent interactions such as the Metropolis-Hastings Naming Game  ( taniguchi2022emergent ; hoang2024emergent ; inukai2023recursive ) , they collectively reduce the collective regularization term (the first term), which no single agent can minimize in isolation.

In that regard, we do not claim that consciousness is exclusive to System 2. Rather, we propose that the fast, sensory-level processing of System 1 provides the essential raw material for phenomenal consciousness. This hierarchical view is well-aligned with Bergson’s philosophy of time. He distinguished between foundational “sensory qualities” (qualités sensibles), which is the equivalent of modern qualia, arising at the minimal temporal resolution of perception, and their integration into a thicker “duration” (durée) where meaningful, flowing experience is formed. Our framework maps onto this hierarchy: System 1 is associated with the emergence of these foundational sensory qualities, while System 2’s reflective consciousness operates within this wider \"duration,\" acting upon the materials provided by System 1.",

One type is “motor memory,” which refers to a series of motor patterns learned through repetition, such as skills and habits in humans. The other type is “pure memory,” which preserves original experiences \\deleted before they become organized into habitual patterns \\added independently of their eventual consolidation into adaptive routines. For example, through repeated trials of bicycle riding (r1, r2, r3), a motor memory for riding a bicycle (R) is acquired. However, one can also recall r1 as a specific life event on a particular date. Pure memory is what retains these unique instances.",

Both automatic and attentive recognition rely on motor memory and share the function of facilitating interactions within stereotyped environments. However, automatic recognition, operating with a “thin” window of the present, is confined to immediate motor responses. In contrast, attentive recognition, with its “thick” window, provides access to pure memory.

Mastering a movement and learning its patterns reduces cognitive and motor control demands when a similar situation arises again. Motor memory effectively serves as a form of temporal outsourcing of optimization. This indicates that motor memory is not limited to internal mechanisms, such as updating motor programs or world models within an organism. Rather, organisms actively modify their environment through behaviors such as marking territory or building nests—and in humans, through artifacts like roads, buildings, and product design—to create conditions facilitating automatic responses that do not require conscious deliberation.",

Treating representations as timescale–contingent strategies—emerging only when slower loops become relevant—avoids the rigidity of any single “-ism” and embodies the flexible stance ( Constant2021 ). This temporal–slicing scenario allows for a dynamic blending of enaction and representation in proportion to the available timescale: shorter loops favour direct sensorimotor engagement, whereas longer loops progressively introduce representational strategies. Bergson had already anticipated this logic: by focusing on how evolutionary elongation of an organism’s temporal architecture —the delays built into sensorimotor coupling—creates room for “memory–images,” he explained the rise of attentive recognition and interpretive acts. In this sense, his view converges with the contemporary account of representations as timescale-dependent emergents ( Bruineberg2014 ).",

Physical laws can be regarded as an extreme form of canalized landscapes. Physical matter, at least as understood in Bergson’s era, does not make “decisions”; its behavior is predetermined and immutable. This constitutes the physical landscape. Next, on the timescale of biological evolution, canalization shapes species-specific landscapes that correspond to their respective Umwelt . Movements such as passive walking, which are automatically generated by morphological features (System 0), are positioned here. On the timescale of an individual’s lifetime, learning further diversifies the folds of the landscape.

In simpler organisms, reactions “can then hardly be delayed” ( bergson1911 , p. 22). Distant perception emerges when organisms become able to “defer the date of their fulfillment” ( bergson1911 , p. 23) of responses. Thus, the presence of a present window and access to pure memory enables non-random improvisations in unforeseen situations, facilitating complex adaptive behaviors beyond what evolution or individual learning alone can achieve.",

As Bergson observed in Creative Evolution (1907), humans, unlike the socially organized yet instinct-driven hymenopterans, have reached an “unlimited” complexity. The present window can be extended through various means, such as conversation, symbolic note-taking, transactive memory, and incorporating cognitive resources of others during deliberation and dialogue. Such interactions with the social and collective landscape effectively serves as shared working memory, as illustrated by the CPC hypothesis (see Section  3.2 ). Thus, the inherently social nature of language is deeply rooted in the dynamic interplay between the landscape and the present window.",

Recent advancements in generative AI technologies, such as diffusion models for image creation and music generation techniques, have sparked debates regarding whether AI can truly possess creativity  ( ho2020denoising ; rombach2022high ; huang2024symbolic ) . While much of this discourse focuses on the “generation” aspect, the essence of creativity extends beyond production to include “evaluation” and “acceptance,” as creative works are deeply rooted in human emotions and embodied sensory experiences. From a systemic perspective, creativity emerges through a dynamic interplay of various components, as emphasized by Csikszentmihalyi”s system model of creativity  ( csikszentmihalyi2015systems ) . Creativity is not solely inherent in the artifact but arises from interactions between the creator, artifact, evaluating community, and contextual factors shaping its creation, such as cultural trends, historical events, and sociopolitical influences. These elements form a cyclical system in which each part continually affects and is affected by others; the artist draws inspiration from the community and context, while the community evolves its standards through the artist”s contributions.",

First, it predicts that a group’s shared symbol system will be systematically shaped by their physical embodiment (System 0). This could be tested in a robotics experiment comparing two groups of robots with different morphologies (e.g., a rigid gripper vs. a soft manipulator) to see if their emergent languages diverge to reflect their differing sensorimotor affordances. Second, the framework predicts that collective adaptation to a new environment will be more efficient through “semiotic plasticity” (re-negotiating the shared language in System 3) than through only individual learning (in Systems 1/2). This can be tested in agent-based simulations by comparing a group that can modify its language to one with a frozen language, measuring the speed of adaptation after an environmental shift.",

Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.",

First, we implement a two-agent world model that integrates CPC-based symbol emergence with temporal dynamics learning in a fully decentralized manner. Second, we demonstrate that environment-general symbols learned through world model prediction—rather than task-specific communication protocols—can effectively support coordination in partially observable environments, allowing agents to complement each other’s limited perceptions. Third, we show that the distributed constraints of our approach lead to the formation of meaningful symbol systems that represent the global environmental state, emerging naturally from predictive learning of environmental dynamics. From the perspective of CPC research, our method extends previous CPC-based approaches temporally, providing a framework that captures environmental dynamics rather than static observations.\n",

A practical challenge arises in calculating equation ( III-B ), as it requires the parameters of the message posterior distributions.

Each agent samples messages from its posterior distribution and exchanges these samples with other agents. Consequently, an agent has access only to message samples from other agents, not to the parameters of their posterior distributions.

This concept is rooted in linguistic structures that give rise to distributional semantics (Harris,, 1954 ) .\nHowever, a crucial question arises: who embedded the “retrievable” information and structures into the sequential data of language? While embedding spaces are important, who created the linguistic structures that manifest as distributional semantics within these spaces? It is not only individual humans but humans as a collective.

The Collective Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis (Taniguchi,, 2024 ) describes a hierarchical structure where individuals perform internal representation learning (i.e., world modeling; see Friston et al., ( 2021 ); Taniguchi et al., 2023a ), and simultaneously, the collective performs external representation learning (i.e., language/symbol emergence; see Taniguchi et al., ( 2018 ); Taniguchi, ( 2024 ) ). The entire process can be characterized as (decentralized) Bayesian inference. In particular, the latter inference (external representation learning) is approximated as Bayesian inference through forms of language games, such as the Metropolis-Hastings Naming Game (e.g., Taniguchi et al., 2023b ; Hoang et al., ( 2024 ) ).",
