It guarantees that in all systems, cultures, and family environments, the rights of children shall take precedence over any other interests.\nThis principle contributes to the realization of fundamental human rights for all.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nWe recognize that all adults were once children and that protecting the human rights of children safeguards the dignity and future of humanity. Every child is entitled to equal dignity and the right to exercise self-determination in their growth.\nHowever, the family system based on blood ties has historically justified privilege and vested interests, often violating the freedom and dignity of children through parents, surrounding adults, or outdated systems.\nSuch violations constitute an unforgivable infringement of fundamental human rights and fundamentally undermine social justice. We firmly believe that allowing this injustice to persist is tantamount to denying the ethical foundation of society as a whole.\nTherefore, the upbringing of children is not the private property of parents but the responsibility of the state and society as a whole. The equitable opportunity for children to grow and succeed is a fundamental human right that must take precedence over all other rights.\nTo ensure that all children—and by extension, all citizens—can develop equally regardless of their environment, and to enable them to freely shape themselves through education and success experiences tailored to their unique characteristics, we redefine the dignity of children as a treasure for all humanity, establishing a universal love that transcends blood ties. By enacting this Act, we aim to make social justice visible through the success of children and to build a culture in which all people share in the human rights of children.\n\n## Article 1 (Purpose)\n\nThe purpose of this Act is to guarantee the rights to dignity, freedom, and safety that children inherently possess from birth, and to protect children from all systemic, cultural, and familial barriers that hinder these rights.\n\n## Article 2 (Definitions)\n\nFor the purposes of this Act, \"child\" refers to all individuals from birth until they reach adulthood.\n\"Protection\" encompasses all systemic measures to support a child in maintaining their physical and mental freedom and dignity while pursuing self-formation.\n\n## Article 3 (Principles)\n\nIn the design of all systems, the rights of children shall take precedence over the rights of parents, guardians, educational institutions, or other adults.\n\nChildren have the right to be protected from emotionally, physically, or mentally unstable environments.\n\nEven within familial relationships, the dignity of children must always be guaranteed. Abuse based on blood ties, poverty, and educational disparities are strictly prohibited as violations of children's human rights.\n\n## Article 4 (Respect for the Will of the Child)\n\nChildren have the right to express their own will and to choose their lifestyle and education based on that will.\n\nDepending on their age and maturity, their will must be respected to the greatest extent possible within the system.\n\n## Article 5 (Monitoring and Intervention)\n\nThe state or local governments shall have the authority to actively monitor households and educational institutions where there is a risk of violating children's human rights.\n\nWhen deemed necessary, measures such as temporary environmental isolation, living support, or protective measures may be taken.\n\n## Article 6 (Obligations of the Educational System)\n\nThe educational system must serve as a place where children can define their own value and develop the ability to build relationships with the world.\n\nAll children have the right to receive individually tailored education suited to their characteristics and to equally enjoy success experiences.\n\nThe system must ensure an environment that does not harm individuality through coercion or pressure to conform.\n\n## Article 7 (Responsibilities of Citizens)\n\nAll adults, recalling their own past as children, bear the responsibility to protect the dignity of children today.\nThis responsibility supports the survival and prosperity of humanity through the human rights of children and applies without exception to parents, teachers, citizens, and public officials, regardless of their position.\n\n## Article 8 (Economic Support)\n\nThe state and local governments are obligated to provide economic support necessary for upbringing, education, and health to ensure the human rights of children.\n\nTo guarantee equal growth opportunities for all children regardless of their environment, the state shall institutionalize a universal child-rearing allowance (child-rearing UBI) and free education.\n\n## Article 9 (Awareness and Consensus-Building)\n\nThe state and local governments are obligated to conduct awareness campaigns and educational programs to build a culture in which all citizens share in the human rights of children.\n\nSuccess stories of children shall be widely shared to promote universal love that transcends blood ties.\n\nThe state shall conduct awareness campaigns to redefine cultural values such as \"children are treasures\" as the human rights of all children, beyond blood ties.\n\n## Supplementary Provisions\n\nIn implementing this Act, the consistency with existing laws such as the Civil Code, the Basic Act on Education, the Child Welfare Act, and other relevant laws shall be reviewed, and necessary amendments shall be made sequentially as needed.\n\nTo achieve the objectives of this Act, the state shall consider enacting the Newborn Equal Opportunity Placement Act (tentative name) to establish a system that eradicates human rights violations based on blood ties.\n\n## Translation Notes\n\nThe tone of the original Japanese text is formal and ideological, emphasizing the philosophical foundation of the law. I preserved this tone in English while ensuring readability for an English-speaking audience.\n\nTerms like \"子どもの人権\" were translated as \"children's human rights\" to maintain clarity and alignment with international legal terminology.\n\nCultural concepts like \"子は宝\" (children are treasures) were retained with explanations to reflect their significance in the Japanese context.\n\nThe structure of the articles and sections was kept intact to mirror the legal format of the original draft."
