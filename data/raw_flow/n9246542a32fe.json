  "body_text": "When I was a child, I couldn't believe in any religion.\nI was taught a part of regionalized Buddhism in Japan.\nAnd over time, I came to develop a strong dislike for that religion.\n\nIt seemed to me that it was a religion that did not try to understand people's feelings and only denied others.\nBecause they didn't even want to listen to my thoughts and just denied me.\nWhen I was a child and I didn't know anything about the world, I started hating all religions.\nBefore I knew it, I had become an atheist.\n\nBut one day I realized that I had the same mindset as the religion.\nI realized that I was thinking the same way as the religion.\n\nIf I continued like this, I would become a person who does not try to understand other people's thoughts and feelings, but only denies them.\nI became afraid that I would become the same as those people whom I hated and feared the most when I was a child.\n\nAnd I started wanting to understand various religions around the world.\nI began to thinking why religion was created in this world\nand why people needed a religion.\neven though my childhood trauma had prevented me from believing in one myself.\n\nThen one day I realized.\nI think what Buddha said was true.\nHowever, throughout history,\nwhen things were passed down from person to person,\nSome people may be getting it wrong.\nI think. I wonder they misinterpreted it.\n\nGotama Siddhattha once to said that\nPeople don't believe what others say or read unless they are convinced by it.\nThe Dalai Lama once to said that\nTry to use Buddhism to be a better version of what you already are.\n\nBut I wasn‘t taught that way.\nNot only that but I was taught the exact opposite and was forced to do it.\nThey said that “This is the true form of Buddhism, and that other forms of Buddhism are wrong.“\nI later learned that there are many different types of Buddhism in Japan, each with a different way of thinking.\n\nIf I had understood the essence of Buddhism correctly, I wouldn't have had to spend my childhood in fear.\n\nIt is very difficult to put my own inner voice into words.\nBut I want to get it right,The feelings that someone entrusted to those words.\n\nThe closest thing to my thoughts right now is animism.\nThere is a concept called ‘Shinto’ in japan.\nJapanese people think gods are in everything in this world.\nSun, moon, sky, sea, mountains, animals, insects, and each grain of rice.\nAnd of course you too, even if you are an atheist.\nBecause, You have “feelings” too, don't you?\n\nThis realization led me to a broader and more inclusive perspective.\nIt's not about what you believe.\nIt's about how you recognize the essence of the world in which you live.\nWe all experience the world through our feelings and thoughts.\nThis foundation is where understanding begins.\nFrom this understanding, I believe we can start to shape our new world together.\nBy sharing our feelings and experiences with one another, we can break down the barriers that divide us.\n\nplease, let me talk to you.\nI'm sure that If I could understand your words, the world would be a lot more fun.\nMay the feeling be with you."
