  "body": "# 🐒 XPathAbu — DomCatcher\n\n![Abu Character Design](docs/abu_charsheet.jpg)\n\n**The street-smart monkey who snatches XPaths right off the DOM.**\n\nXPathAbu is a Chrome extension and the newest member of the [XPathGenie](https://github.com/goodsun/XPathGenie) family. Click any element on a page, get its XPath instantly, and refine it with an interactive breadcrumb navigator.\n\n## Features\n\n- **🎯 Click to Capture** — Click any DOM element to grab its XPath. `<a>` tags automatically append `/@href`.\n- **🍞 Breadcrumb Navigation** — Visual path display parsed from the XPath string. Click to navigate up, **Shift+click** to trim from `//`.\n- **🔴 Index Badges** — `div[5]` shows as `div` with a red `5` badge. Click the badge to remove the index and select all matches.\n- **📋 Copy XPath** — One-click copy of the current XPath (including manual edits).\n- **✏️ Live Edit** — Edit the XPath directly and see results update in real-time (300ms debounce).\n- **🔍 Multi-match** — When an XPath matches multiple elements, all results are listed and highlighted (purple for first, red for additional matches).\n- **🖱️ Drag & Resize** — Drag the panel by the header, resize from the bottom-right grip.\n- **👁️ Inspect Toggle** — ON/OFF to switch between inspect mode and normal page interaction.\n\n## XPathGenie Family\n\n| Tool | Character | Role |\n|------|-----------|------|\n| **Genie** 🧞 | Lamp Spirit | AI-powered XPath generation engine |\n| **Jasmine** 🌸 | Princess | Interactive UI & section selection |\n| **Aladdin** 🔮 | Hero | Multi-page analysis & validation |\n| **Abu** 🐒 | Gangster Monkey | DOM element catcher (this extension) |\n\n## Install\n\n1.
